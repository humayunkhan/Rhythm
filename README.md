# Rhythm
Accords are the building blocks of all fragrances.
"Rhythm" is an AI engine that can re-mix known accords to create new and unique fragrances.

The AI engine will learn to blend new fragrances by getting trained on the historical fragrance formulas.
This project is inspired by "Deep Dream Generator" https://deepdreamgenerator.com

This is a unique branch of AI where a humanbeing will guide the AI engine by providing inputs about "preferences", "tastes" and "likes"
which are unique for each individual.

The aim is to create an AI engine that can process the following inputs:
1. Using the fragrance wheel, the users will select 2 or more fragrances that they are aware of (Ex: Lemon, Jasmin, Oudh)
2. The users will tell how they want the fragrance to be (Ex: Mild and Gentle, Moderate and Refreshing, Strong and Bold)
3. Any other inputs that we will discover over the course of developing the engine.

The Rhythm engine will process the above inputs and create new fragrance formulas along
with the expected fragrance profile of the new formulas.

Thats it!
